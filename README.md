# Welcome to my Numerical Analysis Project About PCR! ðŸ§¬



# Introduction
## What is PCR? 
PCR stands for **Polymerase Chain Reaction**. It's a technique used to make copies of a small piece of DNA many times over. This helps scientists study the DNA's size and the order of its building blocks (nucleotides). PCR is like making many copies of a specific page in a book so you can study it closely and understand it better ðŸ“š

 >> This is done using short single-stranded DNA sequences called **primers** (usually about 20 nucleotides in length), which help identify the section to be copied (**target sequence**).
During PCR, these primers bind to the DNA, and a special enzyme called **DNA polymerase** helps catalyzing the synthesis of new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the growing DNA chain.

## 3 STEPS of PCR Reaction: 
### - Denaturation
### - Annealing
### - Extension
